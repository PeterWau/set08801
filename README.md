## 1. A description of the site that you are planning with enough background context for your reader to understand what you are trying to do.

Having taken up golf as a hobby recently, and been provided with free clubs, I began to play but realised quickly that this is futile without a proper development path.  Being a poor student, I decided that online content could be useful and that the occasional trip to the driving range would be good enough to check my progress.  Combining these two ideas led me to develop Povo-Golf. 

Povo-Golf is a website for amateur golfers who are keen to improve their skills but are unwilling or unable to invest in professional coaching.  It allows you to have a bit of fun with the learning process, track progress and figure out what you need to work on. 


## 2. A summary of any background research into other similar sites, or useful technologies, libraries, or APIs that you have investigated with a description of how this has contributed to your project idea and design.

## 3. A list of features and some discussion of why each feature is included.

## 4. Site organisation and/or navigation tree diagrams with associated discussion and explanation of how you plan to organise the pages that make up your site and how a user might typically navigate through those pages. NB. Your diagrams can be combined if that is a useful way to present the organisation and navigation for your site. These diagrams may be hand-drawn and scanned/photographed, or created using any image/diagram software as you think fit.

## 5. A sketch/wireframe/low/mid/high-fidelity prototype of an initial user interface for your site and some commentary on the motivation for your design, i.e. how does your design address the features you’ve listed? NB. If your designs are hand drawn then they can be scanned/photographed for inclusion in your report.

## 6. A project plan that demonstrates how you will organise your effort and time to achieve your goals. This plan can be presented in any appropriate form, e.g. a list of dates and tasks, a Gantt chart, and/or a narrative description. 

todo

## 7.(Optional) As appropriate: any additional sections that you deem fit to describe your project. For example, if you have decided to implement a particular feature as an extension to the core requirements then this would be the place to report on it. Similarly, if you intend to save data within the browser, then some description of the kinds of data that you intend to store, how you will store it, and how it will be structured, should be reported on

todo

## 8. A short, approximately 3–5-minute, screencast with voice-over of you demonstrating the features of your site (see the "Demonstration Screencast" section below for more details).
